    title: 'Housing Crises Across the World',
    subtitle: 'New York City v Amsterdam',
    byline: '',

    para1:'While both New York City and Amsterdam share the common goal of addressing housing challenges, their approaches can sometimes clash due to differences in their policy frameworks, cultural contexts, and economic models. This website aims to compare NYCHA housing in NYC to Social Housing in Amsterdam. Here are a few areas where their approaches may diverge:',
	para2:'Allocation Method -',
	para3: 'Amsterdam has a centralized allocation system, while NYCHA housing operates through decentralized developments.',
	para4: 'Income Criteria -',
	para5: 'Both programs use income criteria, but the specific thresholds and calculations may differ. The standardized 30% of adjusted gross income used by NYCHA provides consistency across its housing developments, simplifying the rent calculation process and ensuring a uniform approach. While both cities use a percentage of income to calculate rent, Amsterdam may provide more flexibility in the specific percentage applied, allowing for variations based on local policies and housing association guidelines.',
	para6: 'Housing Options -',
	para7: 'Social housing in Amsterdam includes a range of housing options, from apartments to family homes, catering to various household sizes and needs. Whereas NYCHA provides housing in the form of large-scale apartment complexes, with the aim of addressing the demand for affordable housing in various neighborhoods.',
	para8: 'Now lets further explore specific indicators of housing crisis in either city!',

        'Current housing situation: Alex currently lives in a small rented apartment. However, the high cost of living in the city, combined with her modest income, has made it increasingly challenging for her to afford rent and other basic necessities. Alex is determined to find more affordable housing options to ease her financial burden. Alex is seeking stable and affordable housing that will allow her to save money, improve her overall financial situation, and focus on her personal and professional growth.',
        'Alex has been searching for affordable housing alternatives, and she has identified NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) as a potential option due to its subsidized rates for low-income individuals. She understands that the application process may have specific eligibility criteria, and she is prepared to provide all necessary documentation to prove her income level and housing need. She also has interest in social housing in Amsterdam. Amsterdam\'s cost of living may be comparatively lower than New York City, allowing Alex to stretch her income further and save more effectively. Also, the social housing system in Amsterdam is specifically desif=gned designed to ensure a decent quality of life for residents, aligning with Alexâ€™s goals of achieving stability and well-being.',
